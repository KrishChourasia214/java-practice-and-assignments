# java-practice-and-assignments
Just some general stuff i practiced in 1st and 2nd year of my college 
This repository contains coding practice questions and assignments from my self-study through internet. The focus is primarily on Java, covering topics like:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Constructors and Instance Variables
- Control Structures (`if`, `else`, `while`, `for`)
- Method Creation and Reusability
- Input Handling using `Scanner`
- Basic Number Theory (Factors, Primes, Armstrong Numbers, LCM, HCF)
- String Manipulation
- Conditional Logic and Loops
- Modular Coding and Code Organization

This repository is a learning resource and a personal archive of solved problems and assignments.
